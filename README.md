# Work-Day-Scheduler
This is a lightweight app for users who want to keep track of their day on and hour by hour basis. 

The app renders a list of blocks, each with a corresponding hour. These blocks can be clicked on and the user may enter whatever function, meeting, or task that they have to complete before that time. 

Each hour block is color coded so that a user can easily see, at a glance, whether the time has passed, or is in the future. Allowing for good time management. 

## Functionality

The app renders each of the time blocks based on the current hour and choses the appropraite background color. 

Users can click into each time sloot and enter the event that they want to record. This event is then passed into local storage and is easily retrivable on the pages next reload.
